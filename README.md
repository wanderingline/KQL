# Azure Sentinel KQL Queries

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate use of KQL queries to create alerting in Azure Sentinel. Each of the queries have been grouped into folders based on the type of activity they are detecting.


#### MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s)
For each of the queries I have created, I have mapped the detections (where applicable) to a MITRE ATT&CK technique. Full list of techniques and descriptions can be found here:
- [MITRE ATT&CK Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/)

#### References
I have also tried to relate each query to a report which demonstrates how/why each query could be a useful detection for identifying suspicious activity which could be indicative of an attack. These are usually breach reports which demonstrate what actions an attacker has performed.
